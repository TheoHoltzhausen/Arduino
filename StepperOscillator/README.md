This sketch oscillates a stepper motor between two specified angles with a triangular motion profile. Accelerating up to the mid point and decelerating to the other limit.
The circuit includes a selector switch for setting a home / run condition. Home sends the motor to the center position and run starts the oscillating motion.
The sketch uses the AccelStepper.h library.
The cycles per minute is calculated and output to the serial monitor.
